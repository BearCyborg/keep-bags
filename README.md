keep-backpack is a backpack script designed to enhance the inventory management experience for players. With a range of key features.

## Key Features

- **Expanded Inventory Capacity**: Players can carry more materials and items within their inventory, allowing for greater flexibility and resource management.

- **Backpack Props**: The script provides realistic visuals by displaying backpack props on the player's back or hands, indicating that they are equipped with a backpack.

- **Blacklisted Items**: A flexible option allows you to specify blacklisted items, ensuring that certain items cannot be stored in the backpack. This feature helps maintain balance and prevents abuse.

- **Smooth Animation**: Opening and closing animations provide an immersive and visually appealing experience when accessing the backpack. These animations enhance realism and immersion within the game.

- **Locking System**: Backpacks can be equipped with a locking system, offering an additional layer of security for valuable or sensitive items.

- **Prevents Exploits**: The script actively prevents the "backpack in backpack" exploit, ensuring fair gameplay and maintaining the integrity of the inventory system.

# Step 2: Fix for Exploits

The following steps will guide you on how to fix a specific exploit related to backpacks within backpacks.

1. Open `qb-inventory/server/main.lua` file.
2. Scroll down and locate the event `inventory:server:SaveInventory`.
3. Add the following line of code at the top of this event:

```lua
local src = source
```

This will define a local variable `src` and set its value to the `source` argument passed into the event.

4. Find the `elseif type == "stash" then` statement - it should look like this:

```lua
elseif type == "stash" then
    SaveStashItems(id, Stashes[id].items)
elseif type == "drop" then
```

5. Replace this code block with the following updated version:

```lua
elseif type == "stash" then
    local indexstart, indexend = string.find(id, 'Backpack_')
    if indexstart and indexend then
        TriggerEvent('keep-backpack:server:saveBackpack', source, id, Stashes[id].items)
        Stashes[id].isOpen = true
        return
    end
    SaveStashItems(id, Stashes[id].items)
elseif type == "drop" then
```

This new code block checks to see if the `id` variable contains "Backpack\_" within it. If it does, it triggers the `keep-backpack:server:saveBackpack` event which is responsible for saving backpacks within backpacks. Otherwise, it saves the stash items as usual.
